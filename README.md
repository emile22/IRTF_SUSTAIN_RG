# IRTF_SUSTAIN_RG
Working space for developing the draft charter of the proposed IRTF Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG).

At IETF 121 in Dublin, Ali Rezaki and Eve Schooler are holding a Public Side Meeting to present a draft charter for a proposed IRTF Sustainability and the Internet Research Group (SUSTAIN RG). The draft charter document is available in this repository in pdf and md formats. It was also shared in the E-impact, green-wg and IRTF-discuss mailing lists with many comments received via e-mail as well. 
The date, time, room as well as on-line WebEx access link for the IETF 121 side meeting are provided in the agenda file in this repository.
We are aware that the side meeting is difficult to attend remotely. Accordingly, we will arrange an additional on-line meeting about a week after the IETF 121 to ensure participation from remote participants as well.
Thanks very much for your interest and contribution.
